# Doing-Natural-Language-Processing-in-Tensorflow
In this repository , we will look at some of the common techniques used to process textual data and we will implement them in 
Tensorflow. 

This repo includes examples on
1. Use of Basic NLP Libraries in TensorFlow
2. Working with TensorFlow Built-in NLP data-sets
3. IMDB Movie Review classification model
4. Sarcasm Detection using TV Headlines
5. Exploring the BBC News dataset and visualizing the data using the Embedding layer
6. A headstart python notebook on how to generate text using Sequence models
7. An example of shakespearean poetry generation using LSTM
